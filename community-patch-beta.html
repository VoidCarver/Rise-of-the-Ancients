            <h4>"Work Factors" (WF) Overhaul on Farm's gathering rates</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>To be clear, we did not add this "Work Factor Adjustments", they are present in the game since release.
                (This overhaul is mandatory since we're changing move speed in Tool and Wheel speed otherwise Farm's gathering rates
                would go all over the place).</li>
                <li>But why are those "WF" here?<br>
                Well, in AOE DE, Farmers are standing still and farming on the same tile, in an AOE2 Farming Cycle, Villagers are gathering
                a quarter of there carry capacity on each 4 randomly chosen tiles.</li> 
                <li>Devs needed to adjust Farmers to the AOE2 Farming mechanic and at the same time, probably wanted to 
                retain AOE DE Farming balance, so they ended up adding those Work Factors so Villagers move speed doesn't
                impact gathering rates while farming, only specific Farming bonuses (Minoans) or Extra Work Rate (Palmyrans) do.</li> 
                <li>Villagers still benefit from being faster the further away they are from drop off location
                but not in the Farming cycle exactly like it's working on AOE DE.</li>
                <li>A lot of efforts was put into those adjustments to make sure everything is working as intended.</li>  
            </ul>

                Fixed move speed bonus which was incorrectly granting Villagers 12% instead of 10%<br>
                Fixed Food Gatherers adjustments which were only applying to Male Villagers resulting in Male carrying 4 Food as
                 intended but Female only 2 (Sorry Ladies, gender equity has now been restored !)<br>
                Fixed inconsistencies on the list of Food Gathering units which was applying to Forager, Farmer and Hunter but not Fisherman.<br>
                Tooltip now display all the stats and debuff granted rather than a vague description.<br>
